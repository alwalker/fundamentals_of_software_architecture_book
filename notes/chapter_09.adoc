"Top Level Partitioning" -> What is your highest level of abstraction:
- Technical: layers
- Domain: modules

Style Characteristics 
* Component Topology -> layers, modules, etc
* Physical Architecture -> distributed vs monolithic
* Deployment -> monolithic or distributed
* Communication -> mono: internal, distributed: http
* Data Topology -> mongo single db or distributed many db

Strongly disagree with pretty much all of the monolithic descriptions. Especially around data stores.

= The Scope of Architectural Characteristics

Break things down into "quantums" based on the following criteria.

**Independent deployment from other parts of the architecture**. This one is easy, things that are "physically" coupled are part of the same quantum.

**High functional cohesion**. Does large percentage of the code in this namespace/module/whatever refer to/have to deal with itself?

**Low external implementation static coupling**. Does this deployed code share a common set of resources and/or does it depend on the same set of other services as another quantum? 

**Synchronous communication with other quanta**. I don't think this one is a good dividing line for scope. 

Cloud scoping just feels like choosing between IaaS and PaaS.

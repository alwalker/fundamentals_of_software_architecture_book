= Microkernel Architecture Style

aka plugins. Not really a microkernel because of the core concept

Example: insurance software that has per state rules

Core can just be happy path

I think most of the time this is just interfaces

Seem like a good use case for GRPC

Most of the downsides mentioned here are solved by half way decent package management. Anything from Gitlab's crazy omnibus package to Helm. Or just build it in to the core application

Have to be careful about plugin dependencies

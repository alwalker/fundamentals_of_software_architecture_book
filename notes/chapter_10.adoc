= Layered Architecture Style

This is n-tier

"holistic agility" means you need to be aware of how "agile" each layer is. E.g. is it easier to change the UI layer vs the data layer? Is this ok?

Closed vs Open layers. Can you bypass certain layers? Think the PLC layer from the stone

The Sinkhole pattern. This is almost every piece of software I ever wrote. It should be scaffolded but I still think its a good idea because its readable and every one knows it.

Limited code reuse makes it easier to switch out layers

Changing one "entity" often requires changing code in every layer

Why can't we have multiple layers at the same level. Think PLC or different data access technologies.
